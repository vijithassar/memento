# memento.js #

momentary data binding along a timeline for HTML5 media

![clock](./header.png)

# Overview #

memento.js binds data to regions of audio or video and allows you to quickly recall the results at any point during playback or scrubbing. Calling the .data() method on a memento object will retrieve the data corresponding to that point in time. Calling the .data() method repeatedly at different points in time will retrieve different data.

# Data #

memento binds with arrays. Each item in the array must have "start" and "end" properties in order to be recalled at the proper time. It doesn't necessarily have to be a hashmap, though – you can bind an array of anything else (strings, numbers, arrays, nulls, etc) as long as you define "start" and "end" as additional properties on the item first.

```javascript
// fruits with corresponding ranges
var data = [
  {start: 1, end: 7, data: "banana"}
  {start: 8, end: 12, data: "apple"}
  {start: 10, end: 22, data: "pineapple"}
  {start: 25, end: 35, data: "orange"}
]
```

# Timestamps #

Internally, memento represents all timestamps as numerical integers and floats representing elapsed seconds. However, it can also accept timestamps as a string, in DD:HH:MM:SS format. Partial seconds are allowed in this string timestamp format. Unused time elements can be omitted from the string timestamps, so "1:30" will translate to 90 seconds.

```javascript
// bind a data set which uses both strings and integers
var data = [
  {start: 1, end: 7, data: "banana"}
  {start: "0:08", end: "0:12", data: "apple"}
  {start: 10, end: 22, data: "pineapple"}
  {start: 25, end: "0:35", data: "orange"}
];
```

**memento.seconds()** is available as a helper function which will convert string timestamps into numbers. It takes a single argument, which should be a string representing the timestamp. If the argument supplied is a number, it will be transparently returned.

# Setup #

First, instantiate a memento object by running the memento() function factory, which returns a function instance.

```javascript
var project = memento();
```

Use the .node() method to bind that object to an HTML5 media element.

```javascript
// select audio node
var audio = document.getElementById('target-audio');
// bind audio to memento object
project.node(audio);
```

Bind the data using the .all_data() method.

```javascript
// fetch data however you wish
var data_set = get_data();
// bind all data to memento object
project.all_data(data_set);
```

Now, as you play or scrub the audio, you can retrieve the matching data for time ranges which overlap the current playback position by calling the .data() method on the memento object.

```javascript
// retrieve all data bound to the current timestamp
var current_data = project.data();
```

The return value of the .data() method will be a boolean false if there is no data bound to ranges overlapping the current timestamp. If there is matching data, the return value of the .data() method will be an *array* of all matching data elements from the input array. This means that multiple matching data elements can overlap on a particular time position, but it also means you may need to navigate around an array even if you only expect one result.

The .data() method can also take an optional timestamp in string or numerical format to retrieve data for a playback position other than the current one.

```javascript
// get bound data for thirty seconds in
var thirty_second_data = smart_audio.data(30);
```

# Basic Functionality #

Most basic functionality in memento deals with setting up the data binds or retrieving data at a particular point.

- **memento.node()** sets the bound media or retrieves the existing bound media. When used as a setter, it takes one argument, which should be a DOM element for an HTML5 audio or video node.
- **memento.all_data()** sets the bound data. When used as a setter, it takes one argument, which should be an array of data items. When used as a getter, it returns all data, ignoring relevance to the current playback timestamp. Remember that data items must contain properties for "start" and "end" in order to be matched to a particular range. Bound data items without those keys will be stored in scope but will not be accessible using the .data() method, and for the most part will be ignored.
- **memento.data()** retrieves an array of all data elements whose ranges overlap the current playback position. It can optionally take a single argument, a timestamp in numerical or string format.
- **memento.timestamp()** retrieves a number representing the current playback position in seconds.

# Integrations #

memento provides a number of ways with which to expose its internal data, timestamp, and media node information to your custom functions.

Functions that use these integrations are stored as an array of registered functions which is itself saved on the memento instance object. In order to fire integrated functions, you'll need to call the memento instance function in order to get it to start watching the media node timestamp updates.

```javascript
// fire the instance function, allowing
// integrated functions to execute
project();
```

Basic functionality can be used without calling the instance.

### Extend ###

**memento.extend()** binds a new function to the current memento object such that it can be called as a method and access the internal memento data, timestamp, and node information. It takes two arguments: the first is a string that will be used as the name of the new bound method, and the second is a function that will execute when called by that method key. The newly extended method can in turn take three arguments – current data, current timestamp, and media node – after which you can do whatever else you want with them.

```javascript
// create a memento instance
var project = memento();

// define a custom function that takes the three
// binding arguments for current data, timestamp,
// and media node
var my_new_function = function(data, timestamp, node) {
  // do whatever you want in here
  console.log('logging when fired:', data, timestamp, node);
}
// bind it to the memento instance under the method
// name .logger()
project.extend('logger', my_new_function);
```

### Tick ###

**memento.tick()** takes one required argument, a function, and fires it every time the current time is updated by the player. The ticking function in turn takes three arguments, for the currently bound data, the current timestamp, and the media node.

```javascript
// create a memento instance
var project = memento();
// fire the callback function whenever the player updates
project.tick(function(data, timestamp, node) {
  // do whatever you want in here  
  console.log('logging on every update:', data, timestamp, node)
});
```

### Trigger ###

**memento.trigger()** fires a function at a specified point in time. It takes two arguments: the first is a timestamp, and the second is the function to be fired. The triggered function in turn takes three arguments, for the current data, current timestamp, and media node.

```javascript
// create a memento instance
var project = memento();
// fire the callback function whenever the player updates
project.trigger('1:30', function(data, timestamp, node) {
  // do whatever you want in here  
  console.log('logging at 90 seconds:', data, timestamp, node)
});
```
